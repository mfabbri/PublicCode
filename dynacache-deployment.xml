<!-- This file is an example deployment descriptor file for starting grid container
     servers for dynamic cacheing. 
     
     This file can be used "as-is".  It is subject to change with WebSphere eXtreme 
     Scale releases, so it is recommended that it be copied to a separate location for use. 
      
     The following are occasionally changed.  Please refer to the WebSphere eXtreme Scale 
     infocenter for detailed information on each of these parameters. 
      
     mapSet name and mapRef name:
     These values in this file do not directly correspond to the dynamic cache instance name 
     configured for the WebSphere Application Server's cache instance are typically not changed.  
     If, however, these values are changed, then corresponding custom properties 
     must be added to the configuration of the dynamic cache instance .
      
     numberOfPartitions:
     This may be changed to represent the appropriate number of partitions for your configuration.
     For more information see the "Capacity Planning" section of the WebSphere eXtreme Scale InfoCenter.
      
     maxAsyncReplicas:
     A dynamic cache typically is used in a side-cache model with a database or some other source
     as the system of record for the data.  As a result, the space and performance trade-offs required
     make the data highly available discourage the use of replication.  However, in some cases 
     high availability is important.
     
     numInitialContainers:
     This should be set to the number of containers that will included in the initial startup of the
     data grid.  Having this set correctly will aid in the placement and distribution of partitions 
     throught the data grid.
